You slip past the guard—still cross-legged, still turning pages—and down the stone stairs.

The cells are exactly as grim as you'd expect. Cold stone, iron bolts, the smell of rust and damp. From behind the last door, a voice:

"Hello? Is someone there?"

You slide the viewing slot open. Jonah's face appears, squinting, hopeful, and then breaking into the widest grin you've ever seen on a man in chains.

"You absolute *legend*," he says. "Get me out of here and I will write a *song* about you. It will have throat singing _and_ didgeridoo."
