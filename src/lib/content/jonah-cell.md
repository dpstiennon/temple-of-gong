Jonah looks surprisingly cheerful, given the circumstances. He gives you the story of his journey.

The short version: His aboriginal junkyard band finished their tour and flew home to Australia. Jonah stayed. He'd been busking his way across Nepal—didgeridoo, cowbell, throat singing, and spoken-word poetry.

He ended up here. The monks seemed friendly enough. They fed him, gave him a bed. Then he made the mistake of playing the cowbell.

"They went *nuts*," he says. "I've never seen monks move that fast. Apparently bells are—" he searches for the word— "blasphemy. Against the monkey god. Gong good, bell bad. That's the whole theology as far as I can tell."

He rattles his chains for emphasis.

"But listen. The festival tomorrow—the Festival of Ten Thousand Gongs—it's not just gongs. You saw that big idol? The one with the cymbals?" He leans forward as far as the chains allow. "They've got some kind of mechanism in the walls. Gears, pulleys, counterweights. Tomorrow they clash those cymbals together. The sound—" he shakes his head. "It triggers an avalanche. Every year. Buries the mountain path, seals the temple off until summer."

He lets that sink in.

"And I don't think they're planning to keep us around until the snow melts."

You reassure Jonah that you'll find a way to break him out.
