Dorje turns the matchbox over in his hands. He slides it open, examines the red-tipped heads, strikes one against the side. The flare makes him flinch. 

He blows it out. Nods once. Writes on the board:

*WAIT HERE. COUNT TO TWO HUNDRED. THEN GO.*

He slips out the back of the shop and vanishes into the crowd.

You count. You lose track around one-forty and start again from one-twenty, which is probably fine. Then the night turns orange.

The festival supply tent—a sprawling canvas structure packed with silk banners, paper lanterns, and bundles of ceremonial incense—erupts in a column of flame visible from every corner of the square. The fire climbs the stacked banners like a ladder, each one catching the next, silk dissolving into bright threads of light. The incense goes up in a perfumed wall of smoke that rolls across the crowd.

The silence breaks. Guards sprint toward the blaze. Acolytes abandon their posts at the bonfire. The masked celebrants scatter in every direction, their discipline dissolved in seconds.

You step out of the gong shop and walk through the chaos toward the balloon.
