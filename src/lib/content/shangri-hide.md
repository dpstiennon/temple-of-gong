You press yourself into the shadows of a crumbling outbuilding and watch.

The terraced fields are nearly empty. Everyone is moving toward the city—filing through the golden gates in twos and threes, all of them wearing masks. Dragons, demons, serene bodhisattvas. But most of all, monkeys. Some kind of festival, and from the looks of it, mandatory attendance.

You wait until the last stragglers pass, then follow at a distance. Near the gate, an unattended stall displays rows of painted masks on wooden hooks. Your hand closes around a monkey face—red and gold, bared teeth—and you slip it on before anyone turns around.

The streets are strangely silent. Hundreds of people, maybe thousands, moving through avenues of gold and crimson, and nobody speaks. The only sound is the occasional gong—a single deep note that rolls through the streets and fades, followed by more silence. The Festival of Silence, you realize. Everyone's taken it literally.

You keep your head down and walk. Past tea houses with their doors thrown open. Past temples hung with prayer flags in colors that shouldn't exist. Past a gong-maker's shop where a broad-shouldered man works a polishing cloth in slow circles.

A child tugs at your robe. You look down. She holds up her mask—a little tiger—for your approval. You nod. She beams and scampers off.

You almost feel safe.

Then you see her again, half a block away, talking to a patrol of armed men in golden armor. She's pointing back in your direction. The patrol captain follows her finger and finds you.

They're moving toward you, cutting through the crowd with purpose. You have seconds. Ahead, the gong-maker's shop, its door ajar. To your left, an iron grate covering a cistern, slightly askew.
