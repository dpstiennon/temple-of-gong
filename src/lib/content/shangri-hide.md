You press yourself into the shadows of a crumbling outbuilding, watching the city through gaps in the stone. The architecture is unlike anything you've seen—golden spires, carved dragons, prayer flags in colors that shouldn't exist. And everywhere, gongs. Hanging from eaves, mounted on poles, carried by robed figures. As the sun sets, you notice crowds gathering in the streets, all wearing elaborate masks. Some kind of festival is beginning.
