The hands come from behind. Four of them, then six, grabbing your arms, your shoulders, the back of your neck. You struggle, but it's like struggling against the mountain itself. 

A guard says something in a language you don't understand. It's the first voice you've heard spoken aloud in Shangri-La. It sounds like a verdict.

Jonah is already kneeling. He looks up as they bring you forward. His expression says *you too, huh.*

Dawn breaks over the peaks. The gongs ring—the gongs in Shangri-La, the gongs of the temple, all at once, the sound rolling up the cliff face and echoing across the valley. 

The cliff. The wind. And down, down, down.
