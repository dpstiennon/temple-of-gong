The hands come from behind. Four of them, then six, grabbing your arms, your shoulders, the back of your neck. You struggle, but it's like struggling against the mountain itself. They strip off your mask. The crowd parts around you and goes still—genuinely still, genuinely silent, for the first time all night.

A guard says something in a language you don't understand. It's the first voice you've heard spoken aloud in Shangri-La. It sounds like a verdict.

They bind your hands. They march you out of the square and up the mountain path in torchlight, the masked crowd watching from below, Gong's painted face glowing above them all. The path switchbacks up the cliff face—the same cliff you can see from everywhere in the valley, the one that ends in open air and a thousand-foot drop.

At the top, Jonah is already kneeling. He looks up as they bring you forward. His expression says *you too, huh.*

Dawn breaks over the peaks. The gongs ring—every gong in Shangri-La, all at once, the sound rolling up the cliff face like a wave. The high priest speaks. You don't understand the words. You don't need to.

The cliff. The wind. The long silence after.
