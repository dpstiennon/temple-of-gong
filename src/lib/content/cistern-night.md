You wake up and don't know why.

The darkness is total. Not the darkness of a room with the lights off—there's always a crack under the door, the glow of a charging indicator, something. This is the darkness of being buried. Your eyes are open and it makes no difference.

You hold your breath and listen.

Water dripping. The low hum of the vents somewhere below. And something else. Breathing that isn't yours. Close. Closer than it should be. Bob went to sleep ten feet away. This breathing is right next to you.

And underneath it, barely audible: a faint scraping. Metal on stone. Slow and deliberate, the way you'd sharpen something if you were trying not to be heard.

Your heart is slamming. You can't see anything. You can't see *anything*.
