You wake up and don't know why.

The darkness is total. You hold your breath and listen.

Water dripping. The low hum of the vents somewhere below. And something else. Breathing that isn't yours, closer than it should be, and faster than the gentle sound of a man asleep.

And underneath it, barely audible: a faint scraping. Metal on stone. Slow and deliberate, the way you'd sharpen something if you were trying not to be heard.
