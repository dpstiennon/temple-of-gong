You show the monk the postcard. His smile doesn't waver, but something shifts behind his eyes.

"Ah," he says softly. He takes the postcard with both hands, studying the image of the mountain temple with its great golden gong. "The Temple of Gong."

Other monks have noticed. Two more drift over, their bare feet silent on the stone floor. They peer at the postcard, exchanging glances and murmured words in a language you don't recognize.

The young monk hands the postcard back to you with a small bow.

"This temple is high in the mountains to the north," he says. "Very remote. Very... old." He pauses, choosing his words. "The monks there follow a different path than we do. They serve Gong—the monkey god. A protector, yes, but prone to wrath. Powerful. Unpredictable."

One of the older monks says something sharp. The young monk nods, then turns back to you.

"My brother reminds me to tell you: the mountain path is dangerous this time of year. Avalanches. The monks of that temple believe Gong controls the snow—that he buries those who displease him." A slight smile. "We do not share this belief. But the avalanches are real enough."

He studies your face for a moment.

"You seek someone there, yes? A friend?" He doesn't wait for an answer. "The path begins at the north edge of the city. If you have come this far, I think you will not turn back now."

He presses his palms together in farewell.
