Of course, you are not the type to abandon a friend in need. You've canceled your appointments, packed a weathered rucksack, and booked the first flight east. Now, after twenty hours of cramped seats and turbulent skies, you find yourself stepping off a plane into the thin mountain air of Kathmandu.

Your only clue is the postcard itself. The image on the front shows a pagoda-style temple perched impossibly high in the Himalayas, its tiered roofs dusted with snow. But what catches your eye is what stands in the foreground: an immense golden gong, easily twice the height of a man. Embossed in its gleaming center is the face of a monkey—ancient, knowing, its expression caught somewhere between mischief and menace.

You tuck the postcard into your jacket pocket and set off into the city.

Years ago, over drinks that neither of you could quite afford, Jonah taught you the three items one must always pack for any adventure:

* A box of matches
* A comic book (in case you get bored)
* A titanium spork

You rummage through your rucksack. All three accounted for.
