One day in the mail, you receive a mysterious postcard.

The stamp is faded, the edges worn soft from what must have been a long journey. The postmark reads *Kathmandu, Nepal*.

You flip it over. The message is hastily scrawled in familiar handwriting—just two words:

> Send Help

It's signed by your old friend Jonah.

That was about a week ago. Of course, you are not the type to abandon a friend in need. You've canceled your appointments, packed a weathered rucksack, and booked the first flight east. Now, after twenty hours of cramped seats and turbulent skies, you find yourself stepping off a plane into the thin mountain air of Kathmandu.

Your only clue is the postcard itself. The image on the front shows a pagoda-style temple perched impossibly high in the Himalayas, its tiered roofs dusted with snow. But what catches your eye is what stands in the foreground: an immense golden gong, easily twice the height of a man. Embossed in its gleaming center is the face of a monkey—ancient, knowing, its expression caught somewhere between mischief and menace.

You tuck the postcard into your jacket pocket and set off into the city.

The streets of Kathmandu swirl around you—a riot of color, incense, and noise. Prayer flags flutter overhead in tangles of red and gold. Merchants call out from cramped stalls. Somewhere nearby, temple bells ring out in hollow, overlapping tones.

You're making your way toward the nearest tall temple to ask around when something stops you mid-stride.

A narrow shop, half-hidden in shadow, wedged between two crumbling buildings. No sign marks its entrance—just a low doorway draped with a beaded curtain. But through the dim interior, you can see them: gongs. Dozens of them. Hundreds, perhaps. Brass and bronze and gleaming gold, covering every wall, hanging from the ceiling, stacked in precarious towers. Some are no bigger than your palm. Others look large enough to swallow you whole.

The air hums faintly, as if the metal itself is vibrating with some unheard frequency.
