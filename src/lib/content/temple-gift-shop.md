The first building you try is, unmistakably, a gift shop.

Not a temple gift shop. Not a tasteful display of handcrafted prayer beads and locally sourced incense. This is a *gift shop* gift shop—the kind you'd find wedged between a gas station and a Dairy Queen off Interstate 70, with a spinning wire rack of postcards and a shelf of shot glasses.

You eyes move past a rack of shirts that read "I climbed to the Temple of Gong and all I got was this stupid T-shirt" to the checkout counter.

Behind the counter, a monk sits on a stool with the glazed expression of someone who has been on shift since the Qing Dynasty. He does not look up when you enter. He does not look up when you pick up a snow globe containing a tiny brass monkey. A small chalkboard sign on the counter reads: ALL SALES FINAL. NO REFUNDS. GONG BLESS.

You leave the gift shop with more questions than you came in with.
