Somehow you find your way to sleep, in the intervals between the hourly prayer-screams.  In the morning, you experience a whole different kind of rude awakening.

Dozens of hands, lifting you from the mat, pulling you upright. The monks are in full ceremonial robes—saffron and crimson, brass gongs gleaming on their chests. Nobody writes anything on a blackboard.

The courtyard is packed. Every monk in the complex stands is crowded around the cliffside, mallets raised. The sky to the east is just beginning to lighten. You can see your breath.

They bring you to the cliff's edge and push you to your knees. Jonah is already there beside you, hair matted, squinting into the pre-dawn grey. He turns his head just enough to see you.

"Ah," he says quietly. "So that's a no on the rescue, then."

The high priest raises both arms. The gongs begin—not the ragged hourly scream but something orchestrated, deliberate, a wall of sound that builds and builds until it loses all meaning. Then the cymbals of the great idol crash together and the mountains answer. Somewhere below, an avalanche roars to life, sealing the pass, sealing everything.

The gongs stop. The silence after is immense.

The cliff. The wind. The long way down.
