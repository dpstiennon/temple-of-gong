The last tether parts with a sound like a gunshot. The balloon lurches skyward and you throw yourself into the basket, catching the rim with both hands, hauling yourself over the edge as the cobblestones drop away beneath you.

Shangri-La falls. The bonfires shrink to points of light. The masked crowds become a mosaic of upturned faces, gold and crimson and lacquered wood, all staring at the balloon that was supposed to rise at dawn on their schedule, not in the middle of the night on yours. You catch one last glimpse of Dorje's shop—the door still open, the lamp still burning.

The balloon rises along the cliff face. The updraft from the valley catches it, pressing you against the basket's woven wall, and the world tilts as Gong's enormous painted face swings overhead. You pass the monastery walls. You pass the temple spires. The air thins and the stars are impossibly close.

And there, at the clifftop, lit by torchlight and the first gray suggestion of dawn: Jonah.

He's kneeling at the edge. Bound hand and foot. The monks are arrayed behind him in ceremonial robes, gongs raised, mid-chant. The high priest has one hand on Jonah's shoulder. They're all facing east, watching for sunrise. None of them are looking up.

You grab the rope from the basket floor—Dorje's rope, coiled and ready—and throw.

It's not a good throw. It's not a bad throw. It arcs over the cliff edge and lands across Jonah's knees. He looks down at it. Looks up. Sees you, in a woven basket, dangling beneath a hundred-foot silk balloon of a monkey god, drifting past the clifftop in the predawn dark.

His expression is extraordinary.

He grabs the rope with his bound hands and rolls off the cliff edge just as the high priest turns around. For one sickening moment he swings free over the void—then the rope goes taut and you haul, hand over hand, and Jonah crashes into the basket beside you.

The balloon carries you both out over the peaks. Behind you, the gongs of Shangri-La ring out in alarm or farewell or fury—from this distance, it's hard to tell the difference.

Jonah lies on his back in the basket, breathing hard, staring up at the painted face of Gong glowing above you both in the starlight. Then he looks at you. Then he looks at the titanium spork still clutched in your white-knuckled fist.

"Is that a spork?"

Below, the mountains. Above, the dawn. Ahead, wherever the wind takes you.
