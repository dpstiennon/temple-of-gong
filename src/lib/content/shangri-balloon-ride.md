The last tether parts with a loud snap. The platform lurches skyward and you throw yourself flat, fingers finding the edge of the wooden planking as the cobblestones drop away beneath you. The iron grate shifts and sparks scatter into the dark. You press yourself against the boards and hold on.

Shangri-La falls. The bonfires shrink to points of light. The masked crowds become a mosaic of upturned faces, gold and crimson and lacquered wood, all staring up at their sacred balloon rising hours ahead of schedule. You catch one last glimpse of Dorje's shop—the door still open, the lamp still burning.

The balloon rises along the cliff face. The updraft from the valley catches it, and the platform tilts sickeningly as Gong's enormous painted face swings overhead. You pass the monastery walls. You pass the temple spires. The air thins and the stars are impossibly close. The severed tether ropes trail beneath the platform, swaying in the wind.

And there, at the clifftop, lit by torchlight and the first gray suggestion of dawn: Jonah.

He's kneeling at the edge. The monks are arrayed behind him in ceremonial robes, gongs raised. The high priest has one hand on Jonah's shoulder. They're all facing east, watching for sunrise.

Then one of them looks up.

The reaction ripples outward. First one monk, then five, then all of them—staring at the Great Face of Gong drifting past the clifftop with a stranger lying flat on its platform. Some of them drop to the ground, faces pressed to the stone. Others begin hammering their gongs in a frenzy, the sound rolling across the mountains like thunder. The high priest stands frozen, mouth open, hand still resting on empty air where Jonah's shoulder was a moment ago.

Because Jonah is already moving. You grab one of the trailing tether ropes and hurl it toward the cliff edge. It's not a good throw. But Jonah knows what to do.  He backs up and takes a running leap over the cliff edge.  For a second His legs kick in the air, a thousand feet above the valley floor, and then he catches the rope. 

For one sickening moment he swings free over the void—then the rope goes taut and you haul, hand over hand, and Jonah crashes onto the platform beside you. The whole rig shudders. The grate slides. A plank creaks in a way that suggests it has opinions about the additional weight.

The balloon carries you both out over the peaks. Behind you, the gongs ring out—dozens of them, then hundreds, the Festival of Ten Thousand Gongs beginning in chaos instead of ceremony.

Jonah lies on his back on the platform, breathing hard, staring up at the painted face of Gong glowing above you both in the starlight. Then he looks at you.

"Is that a spork?"

Below, the mountains. Above, the dawn. Ahead, wherever the wind takes you.
