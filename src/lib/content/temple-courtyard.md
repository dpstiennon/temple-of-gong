You step through the outer gates into a courtyard of worn stone. Monks in saffron robes move between buildings in silence—not the companionable silence of people who happen not to be talking, but a deeper quiet, as if sound itself has been subtracted from the air.

Each monk wears a brass gong around their neck. None of them look up as you enter.

Except one.

He crosses the courtyard toward you with an unhurried stride, producing from the folds of his robe a blackboard no larger than a dinner plate and a stub of white chalk. He writes in quick, precise letters—English, which strikes you as odd for a monastery perched at the ceiling of the world:

WELCOME TRAVELER. YOU HAVE COME FAR.

You open your mouth to reply, and he watches your lips with the patient expression of someone who has seen this mistake many times before. He taps his ear, shakes his head, and smiles—a broad grin that shows too many teeth. He taps the blackboard with the chalk.

He wipes the slate with his sleeve and writes again:

I AM BROTHER TENZIN. WE DO NOT HEAR. NONE OF US.

You glance across the courtyard. The other monks drift past like figures in a painting. No murmured prayers. No shuffled sandals. The only sound is the wind threading between the buildings and the faint, intermittent pulse of a gong somewhere deep inside the complex.

Tenzin watches you take this in. His eyes are warm, but they stay on you a beat longer than feels natural—studying you, perhaps, the way you might study a map. He erases the board and writes:

YOU MUST BE TIRED. WE HAVE A ROOM FOR YOU.

The chalk hovers. He adds:

OR YOU MAY WALK THE GROUNDS. THE MAIN TEMPLE IS WORTH SEEING.

He gestures toward the central building—the tiered fortress that dominates the complex, its carved monkey faces staring down from every lintel. 

YOUR TIME IS FORTUITOUS. YOU HAVE ARRIVED JUST IN TIME FOR TOMORROW'S FESTIVAL

He erases the board again and writes, this time in larger letters:

THE FESTIVAL OF TEN THOUSAND GONGS.

His smile hasn't changed. It occurs to you that it hasn't changed once since the moment he appeared—not when he greeted you, not when he explained the deafness, not now. The same broad, fixed warmth, like something painted on.
