You climb down.

It takes longer than you expect. The rungs are evenly spaced and solid underfoot, but the rope sways with every step, and the cloud layer swallows you within the first minute. You descend blind—white in every direction, moisture beading on your hands, the rope creaking softly. You count rungs to keep from thinking about what happens if you stop counting. Forty-seven. Forty-eight. Forty-nine.

At rung one hundred and twelve, the air changes. Warmer. Thicker. It smells green—wet earth and growing things, impossible at this altitude. At one-thirty, the clouds begin to thin below you, light filtering up from underneath, and you realize you're descending through the ceiling of something.

At one-fifty, you break through.

A hidden valley stretches below, impossibly green, impossibly warm. Terraced gardens climb the hillsides in neat rows. Golden spires gleam where they catch the last of the sun. The clouds sit above you now—a solid white roof sealing the valley off from the rest of the world.

There's no big sign. No welcome committee. But you know the name of this place—everyone does, the way everyone knows the name of Atlantis or El Dorado. A hidden city of gold, deep in the mountains, cut off from the rest of the world.

### Shangri-La.

You step off the last rung onto soft grass. Your legs are shaking. You let go of the rope and stand there for a moment, breathing.

Then you hear it—a faint creak above you, rhythmic, getting faster. You look up. The ladder is moving. Rising. Someone is hauling it back up through the clouds, hand over hand, and by the time you lunge for the bottom rung it's already out of reach. You watch the frayed end shrink into the white until it's gone.

The monks knew you were coming down. They were waiting.

You're not climbing back up.

You spend a brief moment literally shaking your fist at the sky, then proceed towards the city.
