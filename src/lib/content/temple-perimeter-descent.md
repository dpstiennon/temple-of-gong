You climb down.

It takes longer than you expect. The rungs are evenly spaced and solid underfoot, but the rope sways with every step, and the cloud layer swallows you within the first minute. You descend blind—white in every direction, moisture beading on your hands, the rope creaking softly. You count rungs to keep from thinking about what happens if you stop counting. Forty-seven. Forty-eight. Forty-nine.

At rung one hundred and twelve, the air changes. Warmer. Thicker. It smells green—wet earth and growing things, impossible at this altitude. At one-thirty, the clouds begin to thin below you, light filtering up from underneath, and you realize you're descending through the ceiling of something.

At one-fifty, you break through.

A hidden valley stretches below, impossibly green, impossibly warm. Terraced gardens climb the hillsides in neat rows. Golden spires gleam where they catch the last of the sun. The clouds sit above you now—a solid white roof sealing the valley off from the rest of the world.

You climb the rest of the way down and step onto soft grass. The rope ladder sways behind you, vanishing back up into the white.

Whatever this place is, the monks know about it. That well-maintained ladder is not an accident.
