You put your shoulder against the stone and push.

It's heavier than it looks. The carved track helps, but centuries of mineral deposits have crusted the grooves. You dig your feet in and shove. The stone slides an inch. Two inches. Bob is backing toward the exit, shaking his head.

"You're insane," he says. "You are genuinely, certifiably—"

The stone drops into the mouth of the fissure with a deep, resonant *thunk*. It seats perfectly. The roaring stops.

For a moment, everything is silent. The first real silence you've heard since entering the caves. No rushing water, no hissing vents. Just the drip of condensation and the sound of Bob breathing very fast.

Then the ground shudders.

A low vibration, more felt than heard, rising up through the soles of your feet and into your chest. The mineral deposits on the walls begin to crack and flake. A stalactite drops from the ceiling and shatters on the stone floor.

Bob's eyes are very wide. "Run," he says, and for once you're in complete agreement. He bolts down a side passage—deeper into the tunnels, away from you, a man who knows exactly which direction is safest because he's spent thirty-one years mapping every inch of this place.

You run the other way. Up. Toward the surface. The shaking intensifies. The water in the channels is reversing direction, pushed back by the pressure building beneath the plug. A section of ceiling collapses behind you. Then another. 

You reach the main cistern chamber just as the carved stone buttresses begin to buckle. A slab of masonry—part of the original Shangri-La water system, carved and fitted by engineers who died centuries before you were born—breaks free from the wall and crashes to the floor in front of you. It's roughly the size of a dining table, concave on one side. You grab the edge and hold on because there is absolutely nothing else to hold on to.

The plug blows.

The sound is beyond sound—a crack that hits your whole body at once. A column of superheated steam erupts from below, catches the slab, catches you, and hurls everything upward through the cistern shaft like a cork from a champagne bottle. Stone walls blur past. The iron grate that you crawled through hours ago disintegrates. Daylight hits you like a flashbang. You're still accelerating.

You clear the valley. You clear the cliffs. You are riding a slab of ancient masonry on a pillar of volcanic steam hundreds of feet above the Himalayas, and the only thought your brain can assemble is: *Bob was right. This was insane.*

The steam gives out. The slab arcs. For one weightless moment at the apex, you can see everything—the hidden valley below, the ring of mountains, and directly ahead, the Temple of Gong perched on its impossible cliff.

Then you're falling toward it.
