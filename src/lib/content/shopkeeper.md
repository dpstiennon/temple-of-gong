The emphasis on *delighted* hangs in the air. He's already turned away, rummaging through a pile of merchandise behind his counter. When he turns back, he's holding a small brass bell, about the size of a pear.

"Take this," he says. "A gift. Show it to the monks when you arrive. They will be... most welcoming."

His fingers linger on yours a moment longer than necessary.
