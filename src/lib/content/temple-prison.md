The monks drag you down to the cells and throw you in beside Jonah.

Jonah looks surprisingly unsurprised to see you. "Let me guess," he says. "The bell?" He sighs. "They really hate bells. Something about blasphemy against the monkey god. 

"Well, at least we're together now.  Who knows?  Maybe they like to release prisoners as part of the festival."  He doesn't sound convinced.

Jonah is chained to the wall by his wrists.  The cell door behind you is bolted shut with a crude latch mechanism, the kind of thing that looks like it would yield to a sturdy piece of metal jammed into the right gap. The chain too - the links are solid iron, but they are fastened with a pin that looks corroded.

If only you had something. Something thin, something strong, something metal.
