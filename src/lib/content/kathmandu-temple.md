The temple rises above the surrounding rooftops like a snow-dusted dream.

Five tiers of curved eaves stack toward the sky, each one smaller than the last, each dripping with carved dragons and lotus flowers and the serene faces of bodhisattvas. Prayer wheels line the outer walls, spinning lazily in the mountain breeze. The whole structure is painted in faded reds and golds that seem to glow even in the thin winter light.

You climb the worn stone steps. At the top, a pair of massive bronze doors stand open, flanked by guardian lions whose fierce expressions have been softened by centuries of weather and the touch of countless hands.

Inside, the air smells of butter lamps and old wood. Monks in saffron robes move quietly through the dim interior, some tending to altars, others lost in meditation. Massive thangka paintings hang from the walls—intricate mandalas in gold and crimson, depicting scenes you can't quite parse.

One of the monks notices you and approaches with a warm smile. He's young, perhaps thirty, with the kind of calm that comes from either genuine enlightenment or very good sleep.

"Welcome, traveler," he says in accented but clear English. "You have come far."

It's not a question. His eyes flick briefly to your jacket, then back to your face. Waiting.
