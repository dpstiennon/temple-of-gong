The central hall swallows you whole.

The ceiling vanishes into shadow somewhere far above. Stone pillars line the walls, carved floor to darkness with interlocking monkeys, hundreds of them, climbing over one another in an endless frozen scramble. Brass oil lamps flicker in wall niches, throwing long shadows that make the carved figures seem to shift and writhe at the edges of your vision.

And in the center of it all, the idol of Gong.

An eighty-foot brass monkey, its surface darkened with centuries of incense smoke and lamp oil. Its hands are outstretched, palms up, and in each palm it holds an enormous cymbal—two discs of hammered bronze, each wider than the height of three men, suspended in the air as if frozen mid-clap. The space between them almost hums.

The face is the worst part. Monstrous, yes.  But also serene: A face that could sit in peace for ages and then erupt into sudden violence. The brass has been polished smooth where monks have touched it over the centuries.

Somewhere deep in the walls, you hear the faint creak of ancient mechanisms—gears, or pulleys, or something older. The sound comes and goes, rhythmic, almost like breathing.
