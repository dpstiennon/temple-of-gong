The air is thick with dust and the particular stillness of objects that haven't been moved in decades.

Shelves line every wall, floor to ceiling, crammed with brass chimes of all kinds. Wind chimes dangle from the rafters in overlapping curtains. Temple bells crowd the corners. But most of all, gongs—gongs everywhere. Some tarnished nearly black, others polished to a mirror shine. They range from palm-sized to specimens that would require two men to lift.

The shopkeeper is a thin old man, his face creased like old leather left too long in the sun. He greets you with a silent stare that goes on just a beat too long.

You produce the postcard and hold it up. His expression shifts—recognition flickers across his features, quick as a snake's tongue. Then a smile spreads across his face, the kind of smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.

"Ahhh," he says, drawing the syllable out. "You are the *second* foreigner this month to ask about that place."

He plucks the postcard from your fingers without asking, studying the image of the temple with what might be nostalgia, or might be something else entirely.

"Indeed, high along the mountain path to the north, there is a temple. The monks there are members of a peculiar sect—dedicated to worshipping their monkey god." He taps the embossed face on the gong in the photograph. "They believe he controls the snow, causes avalanches if displeased. Ridiculous superstitions, really."

He says this with an ironic twist of one eyebrow. Something about the way he says *ridiculous* suggests he believes nothing of the sort.

"But they are always *delighted* to meet foreigners."

The emphasis on *delighted* hangs in the air. He's already turned away, rummaging through a pile of merchandise behind his counter. When he turns back, he's holding a small brass bell, about the size of a pear. It has a pleasing weight to it, you can tell even from here.

"Take this," he says, pressing it into your hands before you can object. "A gift. Show it to the monks when you arrive. They will be... most welcoming."

His fingers linger on yours a moment longer than necessary. His nails, you notice, are unusually long and yellowed.

"The mountain path begins at the north edge of the city. You cannot miss it." He pauses. "Well. Some miss it. But I'm sure *you* won't."

The bell is cool and smooth in your palm. The metal has a strange warmth to it that seems to come from within. Is it your imagination, or does it hum faintly when you hold it close to your ear?

The shopkeeper has already returned to his stool, watching you with that unblinking stare. Waiting.
