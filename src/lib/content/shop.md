The air is thick with dust.

Shelves line every wall, floor to ceiling, crammed with brass chimes of all kinds. Wind chimes dangle from the rafters in overlapping curtains. But most of all, gongs—gongs everywhere. Some tarnished nearly black, others polished to a mirror shine. They range from palm-sized to specimens that would require two men to lift.

The shopkeeper is a thin old man, his face creased like old leather left too long in the sun. He greets you with a silent stare that goes on just a beat too long.

He doesn't speak. Doesn't move from his stool. Just watches you with those dark, unblinking eyes, as if waiting for something. His gaze flicks briefly to your jacket pocket—the one where you tucked the postcard—then back to your face.

The silence stretches. Somewhere in the shop, a small chime rings softly, though nothing seems to have touched it.
