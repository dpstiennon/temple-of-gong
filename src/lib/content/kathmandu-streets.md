The streets of Kathmandu swirl around you—a riot of color, incense, and noise. Prayer flags flutter overhead in tangles of red and gold. Merchants call out from cramped stalls. Somewhere nearby, temple bells ring out in hollow, overlapping tones.

You're making your way toward the nearest tall temple to ask around when something stops you mid-stride.

A narrow shop, half-hidden in shadow, wedged between two crumbling buildings. No sign marks its entrance—just a low doorway draped with a beaded curtain. But through the dim interior, you can see them: gongs. Dozens of them. Hundreds, perhaps. Brass and bronze and gleaming gold, covering every wall, hanging from the ceiling, stacked in precarious towers.

The air hums faintly, as if the metal itself is vibrating with some unheard frequency.
