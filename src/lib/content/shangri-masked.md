The mask transforms you. Behind its painted features, you are invisible—just another celebrant in the Festival of Silence. You move through streets of gold and crimson, past temples and tea houses, through clouds of incense. A child tugs your robe to show you her mask; you nod approval and she scampers away. For a moment, you almost feel safe. Then you notice the patrol watching you from across the square.
