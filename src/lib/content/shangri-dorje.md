You slip through the door and pull it shut behind you. The shop is dim, lit by a single oil lamp. An old man sits at a workbench, polishing a brass gong. He looks up at you—and his eyes, behind wire spectacles, go wide with recognition. Not recognition of you specifically, but of what you are. An outsider. He raises one finger to his lips as the patrol's footsteps pass outside.

Then he reaches for a blackboard and a piece of chalk.

The chalk moves in quick, precise strokes. His English is careful, practiced—the handwriting of a man who learned the language far from here.

*I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. I LIVED OUTSIDE. TWELVE YEARS.*

He watches your face. You start to speak and he shakes his head sharply, tapping the blackboard. The Festival of Silence. Right. He erases with his sleeve and writes again.

*MY NAME IS DORJE. I AM A MONK OF GONG.*

*I CAME BACK TO TEACH. BUT WHAT THEY DO HERE—*

He stops. Erases. Starts again, pressing harder with the chalk.

*THEY THROW PEOPLE FROM THE CLIFF. SACRIFICES. THEY SAY IT FEEDS THE MOUNTAIN. I SAY IT IS MURDER.*

He sets the chalk down and looks at you with an expression that needs no translation. Twelve years in the outside world. Long enough to see how other people live. Too long to come home and pretend this is normal.

You gesture. You mime searching. You point to yourself, then outward—*I'm looking for someone.* Dorje studies you for a moment, then picks up the chalk.

*YOUR FRIEND. THE OTHER OUTSIDER THEY CAUGHT.*

You nod.

The chalk scratches faster now. When he turns the board around, the letters are large and jagged.

*HE IS AT THE CLIFFTOP. THEY THROW HIM AT DAWN.*

Dawn. That's hours from now. That's no time at all.

Dorje erases the board and writes one more line. He underlines it twice.

*YOU MUST ACT TONIGHT.*
