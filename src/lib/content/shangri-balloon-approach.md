Up close, it looks even more like a hot air balloon. Because it is one.

The fire isn't just a bonfire on the ground—it's burning in an iron grate mounted on a wooden platform, the heat channeled upward through the balloon's open mouth by a silk skirt. The whole assembly is suspended a couple feet in the air. This wasn't built as a religious icon that happens to float. Someone long ago built a hot air balloon and put a monkey's face on it.

Four hemp tethers, each as thick as your wrist, anchor the balloon to iron stakes driven into the cobblestones. The knots are simple enough—nothing ceremonial, just sturdy half-hitches—but the rope is so thick you can't find a good purchase for your fingers. You pull. You twist. You try to work a loop free. The hemp doesn't give. 

The distraction won't last forever. Already you can hear shouts from across the square, the tone shifting from confusion to anger.

If only you had some sort of sturdy metal tool you could use to pry the knots apart...
