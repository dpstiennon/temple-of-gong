The Great Balloon of Gong looms above you, tugging at its tethers like a living thing. Gong's painted face ripples in the updraft, the golden eyes shifting, the bared teeth seeming to grin. The woven basket hangs just above the ground, swaying gently. Inside it, a coil of rope—Dorje must have placed it there earlier, before any of this began. The man planned ahead.

Four hemp tethers, each as thick as your wrist, anchor the balloon to iron stakes driven into the cobblestones. The knots are ceremonial—elaborate, layered, designed to be beautiful rather than practical. But hemp is hemp. You can't untie them. You can't break them with your hands.

The distraction won't last forever. Already you can hear shouts from across the square, the tone shifting from confusion to anger. Someone will notice the empty guard post. Someone will notice you.

You need to cut these ropes.
