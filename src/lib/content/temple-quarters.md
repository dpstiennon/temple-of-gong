The monks offer you a simple cell—a straw mat, a wool blanket, a window overlooking the clouds. Brother Tenzin writes on his blackboard: "REST. PRAYER TIME AT DAWN." He bows and leaves you alone.

You lie down. You close your eyes. For perhaps eleven minutes, you rest.

Then the world ends.

Every monk in the temple begins shouting at once—a wall of sound that hits you like something physical, a pressure wave of tangled voices bellowing prayers in a language you don't recognize. Beneath the voices, gongs. Dozens of them, struck in ragged unison, the overtones piling on top of each other until the air itself seems to curdle. Your straw mat vibrates against the stone floor. The wool blanket hums.

It lasts maybe five minutes. Then it stops, all at once, like a door slamming shut on a hurricane. The silence that follows feels bruised.

You stare at the ceiling. Your ears ring.

You are just settling back toward something like calm when it happens again. The same eruption—voices, gongs, the whole complex shaking with devotional fury. Five minutes of apocalypse, then silence.

An hour later, again.

By the fourth round you've stopped flinching. By the sixth you've begun to time them. Every hour, almost to the minute: the monks drop whatever they're doing, open their mouths, and scream their prayers while beating brass with mallets the size of your forearm. Then they return to their quiet shuffling as if nothing happened.

You understand now why they're deaf. It's not a mystery. It's not a curse. It's an inevitability. Do this every hour of every day for years on end, and silence isn't a choice—it's the only thing left.

The light through your window shifts from white to gold to amber. Shadows stretch across the courtyard. You watch monks drift between buildings in the calm intervals, serene as sleepwalkers, their neck-gongs glinting. One sweeps the same patch of stone over and over. Another sits cross-legged before a wall, hands folded, perfectly still—until the hour strikes, and he throws his head back and howls with the rest of them.

Night falls quickly at this altitude. The temperature drops like a stone. Stars appear in clusters, more of them than you've ever seen, cold and sharp and impossibly close. The temple settles into darkness. Oil lamps flicker on in windows. The hourly prayers continue, muffled now by walls and distance, but you feel each one in your sternum.

You're not going to sleep tonight. That much is obvious.
