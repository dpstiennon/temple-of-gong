The monks offer you a simple cell—a straw mat, a wool blanket, a window overlooking the clouds. Brother Tenzin writes on his blackboard: "REST. PRAYER TIME AT DAWN." He bows and leaves you alone.

You lie down. You close your eyes. For perhaps eleven minutes, you rest.

Then the world ends.

Every monk in the temple begins shouting at once—a wall of sound that hits you like something physical, a pressure wave of tangled voices bellowing prayers in a language you don't recognize. And then the gongs. Dozens of them, struck in ragged unison, the overtones piling on top of each other. Your straw mat vibrates against the stone floor. The wool blanket hums.

It lasts maybe five minutes. Then it stops, all at once, like a door slamming shut on a hurricane. The silence that follows feels bruised.

You stare at the ceiling. Your ears ring.

You are just settling back toward something like calm when it happens again. The same eruption—voices, gongs, the whole complex shaking with devotional fury. Five minutes of apocalypse, then silence.

An hour later, again.

By the fourth round you've stopped flinching. By the sixth you've begun to time them. Every hour, almost to the minute: the monks drop whatever they're doing, open their mouths, and scream their prayers while beating brass with mallets the size of your forearm. Then they return to their quiet shuffling as if nothing happened.

You understand now why they're deaf. It's not a mystery or a curse. It's an inevitability.

As the fifth round ceases, you watch through your window as a distant mountainside suddenly gives way. A plume of white erupts from the peak: an avalanche.  Was it triggered by the percussive force of the prayer gongs? The cascade of snow tumbles in silence at this distance, a slow-motion catastrophe made beautiful by remoteness. 

Maybe that story about the monkey god and avalanches was more than a superstition. 

You're not going to sleep tonight. That much is obvious.
