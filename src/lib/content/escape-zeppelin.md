Jonah moves through the pre-dawn complex like he's memorized the layout, which—after weeks chained to a wall with nothing to do but listen—he probably has. He leads you to a long, low building near the outer wall. Storage. Sacks of grain, barrels of oil, crates of incense. And in the corner, tossed on a pile of burlap, a beat-up backpack which appears to be made entirely of duct tape.

"*There* you are," Jonah mutters, dropping to his knees and tearing it open. He rummages through it like a man reuniting with old friends. "Spork...yes. Comics... yes. Matches...yes. It's all here, and—"

He stops. His hand closes around something at the bottom of the pack.

"*YES.*"

He pulls out a tightly wrapped bundle, dense and cylindrical, no bigger than a rolled-up newspaper. You have no idea what it is.

"Outside," he says. "Now."

You run. Behind you, somewhere deep in the temple, a gong begins to sound—not the hourly prayer, but something urgent, irregular. They've found the empty cell.

Jonah clips the bundle around his waist, finds a small handle on one end, and pulls. Hard.

A whoosh of expanding gas. A click-click-click of a rigid frame springing into place—carbon fiber struts locking end to end, a skin of silvered fabric ballooning outward with startling speed. In three seconds flat, Jonah is wearing what can only be described as a personal dirigible. A tiny blimp, just big enough for two, straining upward against the harness strapped across his chest.

"Pocket Zeppelin," he says, as if that explains anything. "Grab on."

You grab on. The ground falls away. The temple shrinks beneath you—monks spilling into the courtyard, gongs crashing, the great brass monkey glinting in the first light of dawn.

"Got it off blimp.ly," Jonah shouts over the wind. "Kickstarter, technically. I was backer number fourteen. " He adjusts a valve near his hip. "The company folded, obviously. Never found product-market fit, but the product is *excellent*."
