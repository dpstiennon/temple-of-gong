You strike a match.

The flare is blinding after hours of total darkness. You squint. And there is Bob Kettleman, frozen mid-crouch not two feet from your face, one hand holding a crude knife fashioned from a sharpened stone, the other holding a fork. An actual fork—tarnished silver, probably centuries old, almost certainly looted from somewhere in the city above. He's got a napkin tucked into the collar of his Hawaiian shirt.

A long silence.

"This isn't what it looks like," Bob says.

It is exactly what it looks like.

"I was—" He glances at the knife. Glances at the fork. Glances at the napkin. The napkin is really the thing that's hard to explain. "I was going to cut you some cheese. Cave cheese. It's a delicacy."

"There is no cave cheese, Bob."

"There could be cave cheese. You don't know. You've been here one day."

The match is burning down toward your fingers. Bob's eyes keep darting to it—calculating how long before the darkness comes back and he gets another chance.

You light a second match off the first.

"Here's what I think," you say, very calmly. "I think we should go see those volcanic vents right now. I think we should go together. I think you should walk in front of me."

Bob considers this. He looks at the knife. He looks at you. He tucks the knife into his belt and stands up, brushing off his knees with tremendous dignity.

"Fine," he says. "The morning light is overrated anyway."
