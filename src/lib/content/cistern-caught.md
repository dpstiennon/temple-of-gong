You strike a match.

The flare is blinding after hours of total darkness. You squint. And there is Bob Kettleman, frozen mid-crouch not six feet from your face, one hand holding a crude knife fashioned from a sharpened stone, the other holding a fork. An actual fork, decorated with... a plastic monkey head?  Did that  come from the temple gift shop somehow? He's got a napkin tucked into the collar of his Hawaiian shirt.

A long silence.

"I swear this isn't what it looks like," Bob says sheepishly.

You give bob a long, hard stare.

"I was—" He glances at the knife. Glances at the fork. Glances at the napkin.  "I was going to cut you some cheese. Cave cheese. It's a delicacy."

You suggest that now perfect time to go see those volcanic vents.  You suggest that Bob walk in front of you.

Bob considers this. He looks at the knife. He looks at you. He tucks the knife into his belt and stands up, brushing off his knees with tremendous dignity.

"Fine," he says. "The morning light is overrated anyway."
