Bob leads you deeper. The passages narrow, then widen, then narrow again. The air gets warmer with every turn. By the time you reach the vent chamber, it's hot enough that the stone walls are sweating.

The chamber is enormous—a natural cavern that the Shangri-La-ans widened and reinforced with carved stone buttresses. At its center, a fissure in the rock about four feet across.  Somewhere far below, you guess, snowmelt must meets volcanic rock and boils on contact. The result is a geyser of steam that roars up through the fissure in a continuous white column, blasting through the cavern and escaping through an opening in the ceiling. This is the engine of the whole system. Bundles of copper pipes run back and forth through the column of steam

"Impressive, right?" Bob says, shouting over the roar.

Near the fissure, you notice a large stone—roughly cylindrical, about the size of a rain barrel, sitting on a carved stone track. A plug. The engineers who built this system must have designed it as a shutoff valve—a way to cap the geyser for maintenance on the pipes. Roll the stone forward and it seats perfectly into the mouth of the vent. You can see the grooves in the track where it's been moved before.

You look at the plug. You look at the column of steam. You think about Jonah, chained in the temple above, waiting to be thrown off a cliff.

You think about what happens when you seal a geyser.

Bob follows your gaze to the stone and the fissure, and his expression changes. "Oh no," he says. "No, no, no. Are you crazy? That thing is there for maintenance. You roll that in and the steam has nowhere to go. The pressure—"

"Yes," you say. "The pressure."
