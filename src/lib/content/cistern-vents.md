Bob leads you deeper. The passages narrow, then widen, then narrow again. The air gets warmer with every turn. By the time you reach the vent chamber, it's hot enough that the stone walls are sweating.

The chamber is enormous—a natural cavern that the Shangri-La-ans widened and reinforced with carved stone buttresses. At its center, a fissure in the rock about four feet across, roaring with heat. Not lava—you can't see anything molten—but the air above it shimmers and distorts like a desert highway. This is the engine of the whole system. Snowmelt enters cold on one side of the chamber, passes through stone channels that ring the fissure, and exits the other side as heated water. Centuries of mineral deposits have painted the walls in bands of orange and white.

"Impressive, right?" Bob says from behind you. A little too far behind you. You turn around and he stops walking. "Just admiring the view," he says.

Near the fissure, you notice a large stone—roughly cylindrical, about the size of a rain barrel, sitting on a carved stone track. A plug. The engineers who built this system must have designed it as a shutoff valve. Roll the stone forward and it seats perfectly into the mouth of the vent. You can see the grooves in the track where it's been moved before.

You look at the plug. You look at the roaring fissure. You think about Jonah, tied up in the temple above, waiting to be thrown off a cliff.

You think about what happens when you cap a volcano.

Bob follows your gaze to the stone and the fissure, and his expression changes. "Oh no," he says. "No, no, no. Don't even think about it. That's load-bearing geology. You plug that, and the pressure—"

"Yes," you say. "The pressure."
