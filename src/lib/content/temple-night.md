The temple is different at night. The hourly prayer-screams have stopped—or maybe you've just gone numb to them—and the corridors are empty, lit only by the occasional oil lamp guttering in its niche. Your footsteps echo off stone that hasn't heard a casual footfall in centuries.

You make your way toward the cluster of side buildings at the edge of the complex. Most are dark, shut up tight. But one of them—the low, windowless one you noticed earlier—is not dark at all.

Torches. Two of them, freshly lit, flanking the entrance. And between them, a monk. He's bigger than the others, broad across the shoulders, and he paces back and forth with the restless energy of someone who has been told to stay awake and resents it. His brass neck-gong swings with each turn. He is very clearly guarding something.

Every few minutes he pauses, glances toward the building's entrance, then resumes pacing. Whatever's inside, the monks don't want visitors.

You press yourself against the wall of an adjacent building and watch. The guard's circuit is regular—six paces left, six paces right, a pause at each end. There's a gap, maybe, if you timed it right. Maybe. He doesn't look like someone who'd give you a second chance.

If only you had something that might distract him.
