The next building is different.

Low-ceilinged and dark, it smells of damp stone and something older—incense burned so many times the walls have absorbed it. No monks follow you inside. Storage, maybe, or an old workshop: wooden crates stacked against one wall, rusted tools hanging from pegs, a thick layer of dust over everything suggesting this room hasn't seen regular use in years.

Your foot catches on something. A metal ring, set flush into the stone floor, half-hidden beneath a rotting mat. You pull it. A trapdoor swings open on protesting hinges, revealing a narrow stone staircase descending into darkness.

The air that rises from below is cold and stale and smells of iron.

At the bottom of the stairs, a short corridor lined with heavy wooden doors, each fitted with a sliding iron bolt. Cells. Most are empty—bare stone, rusted chains bolted to the walls, nothing else. But from behind the last door, you hear something. Breathing. And then, quietly, almost to himself, someone humming.

The door is locked, but you can peer through a small window at the top.

Jonah sits against the far wall, wrists chained above his head, looking exactly like a man who sent a postcard that said "Send Help" and then had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for help to arrive. He squints at you in the thin light leaking down the staircase.

His eyes go wide with recognition.
