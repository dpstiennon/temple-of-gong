The city falls away behind you. The noise, the incense, the press of bodies—all of it fades until there's only the crunch of gravel beneath your boots and the whisper of wind through the pines.

The path climbs steadily northward, switchbacking up a ridge that offers increasingly absurd views of the Himalayan range. Snow-capped peaks stretch across the horizon like a jagged white wall, impossibly tall, impossibly far. The sky is so blue it hurts. You've never seen so much *nothing*—just mountains and sky and the thin ribbon of trail ahead.

You pause to catch your breath. The air is thinner here, sharper. Your lungs work harder than they should.

The problem, of course, is that you have no idea where you're going. The path branches ahead—one fork climbing higher into the snow, another descending into a valley thick with rhododendrons. There's no signage. No helpful monks. Just you, the mountains, and a vague sense that Jonah is out here somewhere, waiting.

You feel bold. Intrepid, even. These are good feelings to have when you're hopelessly lost in foreign mountains with inadequate supplies and no backup plan.

The wind picks up, and somewhere far above, a bird of prey circles lazily against the impossible blue.
