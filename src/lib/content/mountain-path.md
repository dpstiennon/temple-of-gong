The city falls away behind you. The noise, the incense, the press of bodies—all of it fades until there's only the crunch of gravel beneath your boots and the whisper of wind through the pines.

You follow a path steadily northward, switchbacking up a ridge that offers increasingly absurd views of the Himalayan range. Snow-capped peaks stretch across the horizon like a jagged white wall, impossibly tall, impossibly far. The sky is so blue it hurts.

The problem, of course, is that you have no idea where you're going.
