You step back from the fissure. Bob is right. It's crazy. Cap a volcanic vent and ride the explosion out of a hidden valley? That's not a plan. That's a way to die.

Bob's shoulders sag with relief. "Smart," he says. "Smart choice. Come on. Let's go back to camp. I'll show you where the best mushrooms grow."

You go back to camp. Bob shows you where the best mushrooms grow. They're actually pretty good.

Days pass. Weeks. You and Bob become something like friends—the kind of friendship born not of shared interests but of shared circumstances and a mutual understanding that certain topics are better left unexplored. You don't ask about the fork. He doesn't bring it up.

You carve your own calendar into the wall, next to his. You learn the tunnels. You learn which water channels carry the warmest water, and which pools are deep enough to bathe in. You learn to catch the blind cave fish that swim in the lower cisterns, and to cook them over the volcanic vents.

It's not a bad life, all things considered.

But on quiet nights—and they're all quiet, down here—you think about Jonah. You think about the temple on the cliff. You wonder if there was a ceremony, and if there were gongs.

And you think about Bob, asleep ten feet away, and the fork, and what he meant to do with it.

You never do stop wondering about that.
