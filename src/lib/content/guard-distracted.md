You toss the comic book. It lands open at the guard's feet, colorful panels facing up.

He stops pacing. Looks down. Picks it up with both hands, the way you'd pick up something fragile, and tilts it toward the torchlight. His brow furrows. He turns it right-side up. His lips move as he works through the panels—a man who has perhaps never seen a comic book before, confronted with the entire concept of sequential art all at once.

He sits down against the wall, cross-legged, the comic spread across his lap. He is not getting up anytime soon.

A ring of iron keys hangs from his belt. You lift them without a sound.
