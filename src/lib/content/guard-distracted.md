When the guard's back is turned, you lay the comic book on the ground, colorful panels facing up.

He stops pacing. Looks down. Picks it up with both hands, the way you'd pick up something fragile, and tilts it toward the torchlight. Immediately, his rough-hewn face lights up with a grin.  He sits down against the wall, cross-legged, the comic spread across his lap. He chuckles out loud as he turns through the pages, following those ducks on their wild adventure.  

While the guard is engrossed in the comic, you seize the opportunity to sneak past him and through the door.  As you tiptoe past, you gently lift the ring of iron keys hanging from his belt.
