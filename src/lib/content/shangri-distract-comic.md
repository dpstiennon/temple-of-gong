Dorje studies the comic book. He turns the pages slowly, one at a time. The garish colors. The cartoon ducks in their sailor suits, getting into improbable scrapes. His mouth twitches. He covers it with his hand. His shoulders shake.

He composes himself, sets the comic down, and writes on the board:

*WAIT HERE. COUNT TO TWO HUNDRED. THEN GO.*

He tucks the comic into his robe and slips out the back of the shop.

You count. Somewhere around one-sixty you hear it—a sound you haven't heard since arriving in Shangri-La. Laughter. Not quiet laughter, either. The helpless, wheezing kind that feeds on itself, the kind where someone tries to stop and then looks at the thing again and it gets worse.

You edge to the window. Dorje is standing near the balloon, holding the comic open for a cluster of guards. One of them is pointing at a panel, shaking with suppressed hilarity. Another has given up suppressing anything and is bent double, mask pushed up on his forehead, tears streaming. A third guard grabs the comic to get a closer look and two more crowd in behind him.

The post by the balloon is empty. Every guard in the square has drifted toward the circle of laughter like iron filings toward a magnet.

You step out of the gong shop and walk straight to the balloon. Nobody looks up.
