You heave the grate aside and drop into darkness. The fall is longer than expected—you land hard in cold water up to your knees. Above, you hear the patrol's boots on the cobblestones, voices calling. Then the grate scrapes back into place, and you're alone in the dark. Alone until a hand grips your arm and a voice whispers: "Don't scream. I'm going to save your life. Follow me."  The voice is English; not the accented English you've heard in Kathmandu, but plain American English.
