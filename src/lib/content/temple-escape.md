Jonah whoops aloud. The sound bounces off every stone surface in the complex, a full-throated shout of joy that would wake any monastery in the world.

Then you both freeze.

Nothing. No doors opening, no sandals slapping stone. The monks sleep on, locked in their perfect silence. Right. Deaf.

You creep up the stairs, past the guard—still absorbed in his comic. The sky to the east is beginning to glow, that thin grey light that comes just before dawn.

The temple entrance is fifty yards ahead. Freedom. The mountain path. Home.

Jonah grabs your arm and stops you dead.

"Wait. Think. As soon as the monks notice we're gone, they'll activate that idol—the cymbals, the avalanche. The pass will be buried in minutes." His eyes are wide but steady. "My pack. They took it when they locked me up. I've got something in there that'll get us out. But we have to find it first."

The temple gates are right there. The path down the mountain is clear. Dawn is coming fast.
