You wait in Dorje's shop as the last light drains from the sky. He brings you tea—real tea, in a chipped ceramic cup—and goes back to polishing gongs, his hands steady, his face unreadable. The patrol passes twice more. Each time, Dorje glances at the door but doesn't stop working.

Through the shop window you watch the Festival of Silence reach its climax. The masked crowds pack the central square, faces tilted upward, silent despite the thousands pressed together. Torchlight catches gold and crimson and lacquered wood.

And then you see it.

In the center of the square, a team of workers feeds a bonfire. The heat shimmers upward into the mouth of something vast—a silk canopy, painted and stitched, slowly swelling as the hot air fills it. It takes shape as you watch. First the rounded crown, then the cheeks, then the bared teeth and golden eyes. The face of Gong. The brass monkey idol rendered in silk and pigment, a hundred feet tall, straining at four thick hemp tethers as it rises above the square.

Dorje appears at your shoulder. He picks up the blackboard.

*THE GREAT FACE OF GONG. IN THE TEMPLE, WE HAVE HIS IMAGE IN BRASS.  IN THE VALLEY, WE HAVE THIS*

It looks, for all the world, like a hot air balloon, with the snarling face of Gong painted across it.

You stare at the balloon. The tethers creak and groan as it swells. Hot air. Hot air rising.  Hot air balloon. You suddenly have a wild idea of how you might rescue Jonah.

You take the slate and explain it to Dorje.

Dorje reads it. His eyes widen. Then he does something unexpected. He smiles.

He takes the chalk back.

*I CAN CREATE A DISTRACTION. DRAW THE GUARDS AWAY. BUT I NEED SOMETHING FROM THE OUTSIDE. SOMETHING STRANGE. SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE.*

He looks at you. Then he looks, pointedly, at your pockets.

*DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING?*
