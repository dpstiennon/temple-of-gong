You wait in Dorje's shop as the last light drains from the sky. He brings you tea—real tea, in a chipped ceramic cup—and goes back to polishing gongs, his hands steady, his face unreadable. The patrol passes twice more. Each time, Dorje glances at the door but doesn't stop working.

Then the drums begin.

Low and slow at first, felt more than heard, vibrating up through the stone floor. Through the shop window you watch the Festival of Silence reach its climax. The masked crowds pack the central square, faces tilted upward, utterly silent despite the thousands pressed together. Torchlight catches gold and crimson and lacquered wood.

And then you see it.

In the center of the square, a team of workers feeds an enormous bonfire. The heat shimmers upward into the mouth of something vast—a silk canopy, painted and stitched, slowly swelling as the hot air fills it. It takes shape as you watch. First the rounded crown, then the cheeks, then the bared teeth and golden eyes. The face of Gong. The brass monkey idol rendered in silk and pigment, a hundred feet tall, straining at four thick hemp tethers as it rises above the square.

The Great Balloon of Gong.

The crowd watches in absolute silence. The balloon glows from within, lit by the bonfire beneath, Gong's painted face luminous against the night sky. A woven basket hangs beneath it, big enough for two.

Dorje appears at your shoulder. He's written on the blackboard again.

*THE BALLOON RISES AT DAWN. IT WILL PASS THE CLIFFTOP WHERE THEY HOLD YOUR FRIEND.*

He erases. Writes again.

*IF YOU WERE IN THAT BASKET...*

He taps the chalk against the board, thinking. Then:

*I CAN CREATE A DISTRACTION. DRAW THE GUARDS AWAY FROM THE BALLOON. BUT I NEED SOMETHING FROM THE OUTSIDE. SOMETHING STRANGE. SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE.*

He looks at you. Then he looks, pointedly, at your pockets.

*DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING?*
