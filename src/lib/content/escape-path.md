"No time!" you shout, and drag Jonah toward the gates.

You sprint down the mountain path, lungs burning in the thin air. Jonah runs beside you, barefoot, cursing at every sharp stone. The sky brightens. Behind you, the temple shrinks against the mountainside. You're going to make it.

Then you hear it.

Not gongs—not the hourly prayer-scream you've grown numb to. Something deeper. A single, massive concussion that rolls across the peaks like thunder, followed by a metallic shudder you feel through the soles of your feet. The cymbals. The monks have found the empty cell and activated the idol.

For a moment, nothing.

Then the rumbling starts.

You look up. The entire mountainside above the path is moving—slowly at first, almost gracefully, a white curtain sliding free. Then not slowly at all. Jonah grabs your arm.  He doesn't actually say it out loud, but his arched eyebrow says "Told you so."
