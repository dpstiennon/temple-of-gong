The slab hits the courtyard of the Temple of Gong at an angle, skipping once off the flagstones like a hurled stone skipping off water, carving a trench through the ornamental garden, and coming to rest with a crash against an immense brass gong, with a noise that makes every gong in the temple ring in sympathy.

You tumble off. Your ears are ringing. You're covered in dust and mineral deposits and your eyebrows may be singed. But you're alive, and you're standing in the temple courtyard, and the first thing you see—the very first thing—is Jonah.

He's ten feet away, kneeling at the edge of the cliff. The monks are arrayed behind him in ceremonial robes, gongs raised. The high priest has one hand on Jonah's shoulder, ready to push.

Every single one of them is staring at you. At the slab. At the trench. At the smoldering ruin of the ornamental garden. The chanting has stopped.

Jonah looks at you. His expression says several things at once, chief among them *what* and *how* and *is that a piece of a cistern*.

You don't explain. You grab him, haul him to his feet, and run.
