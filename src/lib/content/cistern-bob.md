The hand pulls you through knee-deep water, around corners you can't see, through passages that narrow until your shoulders scrape stone on both sides. The sound of the patrol fades. The sound of dripping water does not.

Then a match flares—not yours—and you see him. A wiry man in his fifties, maybe sixties, skin tanned to leather by decades of lamp-soot and geothermal steam. He's wearing what was once a Hawaiian shirt. It's been patched so many times it's become a kind of textile archaeology, each repair a different scrap of Shangri-La cloth layered over the original hibiscus print.

"Bob," he says, extending a hand. "Bob Kettleman. Topeka, Kansas. Well—formerly Topeka. Currently—" he gestures around at the cave. "This."

He leads you deeper. The passages open up, and you begin to understand what you're standing in. It's not just a cistern. It's infrastructure. Beams of light peep through grates high aboe, providing a dim illumination.  Channels carved into the rock direct snowmelt from the peaks above into holding basins. The water flows through stone basins that pass over volcanic vents—you can feel the heat rising through the soles of your shoes—and emerges warm on the other side. Heated running water, engineered centuries ago, feeding every bath and kitchen in the city above.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Bob says. "The Shangri-La-ans are smart people. Talented engineers. Lovely culture." He pauses. "Murderous, though."

He explains. Any outsider found in the valley is taken to the Temple of Gong and sacrificed—hurled off the cliff as an offering. It's been this way for centuries. The Shangri-La-ans are not cruel about it. They consider it a great honor. They throw a little ceremony. There are gongs.

Your friend Jonah, Bob says, is as good as dead.

"How did you survive?" you ask.

"Fell in." He taps the grate above. "Thirty-one years ago. Hiking trip went sideways. Landed down here, broke my ankle, never went back up." He shrugs. "It's not so bad. I eat what comes down—scraps, the occasional animal, and..." He trails off. "Anyway. Plenty to eat."  He changes the subject a little too quickly.

He shows you his camp—a dry ledge above the waterline, a bed of old cloth, a collection of salvaged odds and ends that would make a respectable exhibit in a museum of solitude. He's carved a calendar into the wall. Eleven thousand three hundred and fifteen days.

"There's more to see," he says. "The volcanic vents, deeper in. Incredible. But it's too dark to go now—easy to fall into a fissure if you don't know the path." He settles onto his bed and pats the stone beside him. "In the morning. I promise."

You don't have a better option. You settle in. The stone is warm from the vents below. Bob blows out his lamp, and the darkness is absolute.
