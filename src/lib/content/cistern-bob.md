The hand pulls you through knee-deep water, around corners you can't see, through passages that narrow until your shoulders scrape stone on both sides. The sound of the patrol fades. The sound of dripping water does not.

He leads you deeper. The passages open up, and you begin to understand what you're standing in. It's not just a cistern. It's infrastructure. Beams of fading sunlight peep through grates high above, providing a dim illumination.  Channels carved into the rock direct snowmelt from the peaks above into holding basins. Copper pipes run along the walls, you can feel warmth radiating from them.

You can finally make out your guide.  A wiry man in his fifties, maybe sixties, with the pale skin of a man who doesn't often see the sun. He's wearing what was once a Hawaiian shirt. It's been patched so many times it's become a kind of textile archaeology, each repair a different scrap of Shangri-La cloth layered over the original hibiscus print.

"Bob," he says, extending a hand. "Bob Kettleman. Topeka, Kansas. Well—formerly Topeka. Currently—" he gestures expansively. "This."

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Bob says. "The Shangri-La-ans are smart people.  They've got a whole system - use the volcanic vents down below to get heated running water for the whole city.  Talented engineers. Lovely culture." He pauses. "Murderous, though."

He explains. Any outsider found in the valley is imprisoned until the next festival, then sacrificed—hurled off the cliff as an offering. It's been this way for centuries. The Shangri-La-ans are not cruel about it. They consider it a great honor. They have a nice ceremony. There are gongs.

Your friend Jonah, Bob says, is as good as dead.

"How did you survive?" you ask.

"Fell in." He taps the grate above. "Thirty-one years ago. Hiking trip went sideways. Landed down here, broke my ankle, never went back up." He shrugs. "It's not so bad. I eat what I can get - cave mushrooms, scraps from above, the occasional animal, and..." He trails off. "Anyway. Plenty to eat."  He changes the subject a little too quickly.

He shows you his camp—a dry ledge above the waterline, a bed of old cloth, a collection of salvaged odds and ends that would make a respectable exhibit in a museum of solitude. He's carved a calendar into the wall. Eleven thousand three hundred and fifteen days.

"There's more to see," he says. "Those volcanic vents, deeper in. Incredible. But it's getting too dark to go now—easy to fall into a fissure if you don't know the path." He settles onto his bed and pats the stone beside him. "In the morning. I promise."

You don't have a better option. You settle in. The stone is warm from the vents below. Before long, the darkness is absolute.
