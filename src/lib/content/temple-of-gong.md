The map doesn't lie, but it also doesn't mention the vertigo.

Three days you climb. The path is clear enough—worn smooth by centuries of pilgrims—but it clings to cliffsides that would make a mountain goat reconsider its life choices. You learn not to look down. You learn not to look up either, because then you see how much further you have to go.

The air thins. Your lungs burn. You sleep in shallow caves and wake shivering, frost on your eyelashes, the stars impossibly bright and close. By the second night you've stopped thinking about Jonah, about the postcard, about anything except the next foothold, the next handhold, the next breath.

On the third afternoon, the path crests a final ridge and you see it.

The Temple of the Monkey God sprawls across an entire mountain peak, a complex of courtyards and shrines and lesser buildings arranged around a central structure that defies the word "temple." It is a fortress. A palace. A stone fist raised against the sky. The main building rises in tiers, each level smaller than the last, black rock fitted together without mortar and carved with thousands of figures—monkeys, demons, gods, all frozen mid-motion in the ancient stone.

The surrounding peaks pierce the clouds like teeth. Below, where valleys should be, there is only mist—white and absolute, as if the rest of the world has simply ceased to exist. You stand at the roof of everything.

Prayer flags crisscross the complex in faded reds and yellows, snapping in the thin wind. Somewhere inside, barely audible, a gong sounds—low and resonant, felt more than heard.

The outer gates stand open. No one comes to greet you.
