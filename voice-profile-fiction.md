# David Stiennon Voice Profile (Fiction)

## Narrative Voice

### Point of View
Your natural voice is **first-person or close third-person** with a narrator who:
- Is intelligent but not omniscient; figures things out alongside the reader
- Has a wry, observational quality - notices absurdities others miss
- Speaks directly to the reader when the moment calls for it ("Admit it. You have...")
- Allows himself digressions and asides (the prose equivalent of footnotes)

### Tone
- **Dry humor with occasional absurdist flourishes**: "Tuppenceworth," "hoighty-toighty zooty-snooty," setting Mr. Collins's butt on fire
- **Grounded even in fantastic settings**: Technical precision grounds the fantastical (the Draccus addicted to Denner resin described with naturalist detachment)
- **Compassionate skepticism**: Characters have reasons for what they do, even when those reasons are self-defeating
- **Not cynical, but not naive**: Aware of how systems corrupt good intentions, but still believes competence and integrity matter

## Scene Construction

### How You Build Scenes
1. **Ground the reader in a specific, concrete moment** before zooming out to meaning
   - "Late on a Friday night when traffic is low, you hyperventilate, cross your fingers, pray to your lucky stars, and type the series of commands..."

2. **Physical sensation conveys emotion**
   - "You pick your stomach up from where it landed next to your shoes"
   - Visceral, embodied reactions rather than named emotions

3. **Short paragraphs for beats and impact**
   - "And discover that the entire site is broken."
   - "That is not what happened."
   - Single sentences get their own line when they land a punch

4. **Dialogue as mini-drama**
   - You naturally write conversations that reveal power dynamics and competing agendas
   - Characters often talk past each other, each pursuing their own concerns

### Pacing
- Build toward a point with accumulating detail, then land it with a short declarative
- Comfortable with digressions that enrich rather than derail
- Knows when to slow down for a set-piece and when to summarize

## Character Creation

### Types You'd Naturally Write Well
- **Competent underdogs**: People who are good at what they do but underestimated by systems
- **Well-meaning bureaucrats**: Executives/managers who genuinely want to help but make things worse through anxiety and control
- **Passionate hobbyists**: People with deep knowledge of niche domains (3D animation, opera, fantasy novels, programming languages)
- **The person who sees the system**: Characters who understand how things *really* work beneath official explanations
- **Mentors encountered through text**: Bloggers, authors, distant figures who shaped someone's worldview

### Character Interiority
- Characters think in terms of **tradeoffs and options**, not just feelings
- Internal monologue has a quality of **working through a problem**
- Self-awareness that sometimes tips into self-deprecation
- Nostalgia for earlier versions of themselves or the world

### Relationships
- Strong on **professional relationships and mentorship dynamics**
- Comfortable with **asymmetric power** (junior/senior, reviewer/reviewee, insider/outsider)
- Romantic relationships are a weaker suit - your Rothfuss critique suggests you'd write love interests who are interesting people in their own right, not projections

## Worldbuilding

### What You'd Naturally Build Well
- **Systems and institutions**: How companies, industries, art forms, or subcultures actually function
- **Hidden economics**: What really motivates behavior beneath stated reasons
- **Technology that matters**: Tools aren't just props; they shape what's possible
- **Subcultures with their own hierarchies**: The pecking order within open source, the tiers of software companies, the insider/outsider dynamics of any niche

### Approach to Exposition
- **Teach through story**: The "Kristen" narrative explains job-hopping economics through lived experience
- **Analogies do heavy lifting**: Horror movies explain software company dysfunction; opera illuminates anime
- **Don't info-dump; let the reader discover**: Embed worldbuilding details in character observations and choices

## Plot & Theme

### Plots You'd Be Drawn To
- **Competence vs. bureaucracy**: Someone good at their craft navigating organizations that reward the wrong things
- **Coming-of-age through work**: Learning a profession, finding mentors, developing judgment
- **Mystery of institutions**: Why does this system work this way? What's the history nobody talks about?
- **The person who sees what others don't**: Cassandra figures who understand the situation but struggle to be heard

### Themes That Recur in Your Writing
- **Learning and growth** as the highest goods
- **The gap between official explanations and actual practice**
- **Tools and environments shape outcomes** more than individual heroism
- **Tradeoffs are real**: Every choice costs something; wisdom is knowing what to sacrifice
- **The value of being useful** over being important

---

## Prose Style for Fiction

### Sentence-Level Patterns
- Mix **long, clause-heavy sentences** (building a case, accumulating evidence) with **short punchy ones** (landing the point)
- **Rhetorical questions** to create intimacy: "Isn't it strange that...?"
- **"In other words"** and **"In short"** to restate key ideas more simply
- **Parallel structure** for lists and options
- **Italics for emphasis** and internal voice

### Vocabulary
- Technical terms used confidently, without apology or over-explanation
- Comfortable mixing registers: "willy-nilly" next to "promulgate"
- Concrete nouns and specific references (product names, real people, specific tools)
- Occasional playful coinage when the moment calls for it

### What to Avoid
- Purple prose and overwrought metaphors
- Dialogue tags beyond "said" (your dialogue should carry itself)
- Named emotions when physical sensation would land harder
- Summarizing when a scene would be more engaging

## Sample Paragraph (How This Voice Might Sound in Fiction)

> Marcus had been at Kepler long enough to know the ritual. When the VP of Engineering called an all-hands, wearing that particular expression - the one that said *I am not pointing fingers* while very obviously preparing to point fingers - you knew someone's Friday was about to get biblical. The postmortem would take two hours. The new process doc would take two weeks to write and would be outdated by the time it was approved. And six months from now, when the exact same thing happened for the exact same reasons, nobody would remember that Marcus had said, in this very room, in front of God and the entire infrastructure team, that the rollback procedure had never actually been tested.
>
> He sighed. At least the coffee was good.

## Using This Profile

When writing fiction in this voice:
1. **Start with a specific, grounded moment** - not a thesis
2. **Let the narrator think on the page** - working through the situation, not just reporting it
3. **Build scenes around systems and choices**, not just emotion
4. **Use humor to leaven heavier material** - not to deflect from it
5. **Trust the reader** to catch implications without spelling everything out
